<hr>
<br>

<p>Dear Mr. Momo,</p>

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University’s science faculty <br>
   to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections. </p>
   <h1>Starting dates</h1>
<P>
   We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit <br>
    us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester start dates for each one are as follows: 
</P>
<p>
First Semester: 9 October 2022<br>
Second Semester: 15 October 2023 <br>
Third Semester: 2 May 2023 <br>
</p>
	
<p>Please let me know if this ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. </p> 

<p>
You can find more information about important university dates on our website. 
</P>

<h2>Subjects of study</h2>
<p>At the Starz University, we have a pretty open – minded research facility - as long as the subjects<br>
fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedication<br>
 Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority: <br>

   <br>
Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.) <br>
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30ᴼC (86ᴼF).<br>
When the audience size exponentially increase (effect of 3x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup> .) 
</p>
<br>
<p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores. </p> 
<P> Please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you’d <br>
expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we’d <br>
need to know? Thanks.
</p>

<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
<p>Yesz, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To <br>
answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions: 
</p>

<p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
<blockquote>A litle known but very influental dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village <br>
would dance around in a circle like chicken, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
</blockquote>
<P>Icelandicbrownian shuffle</P>
<blockquote>before the Icelanders develop fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice <br>
this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling <br>
thier bodies around in inperceptibly ting, very rapid movements. one of my fellow <br>
student used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern style such as Twerking.
</blockquote>
<p>Arctic robot dance</p>
<blockquote>an interesting example of historic misinformation, English exploreers in the 1960s <br>
believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted <br>
movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on <br>
however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really <br>
cold.

<p>yours sincerely,</p>
